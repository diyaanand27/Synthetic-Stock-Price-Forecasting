# To Run

**Linear Regression Model** <br/><br/>
  Run linear_regression_market.py, which uses data/raw-2022/market.csv data <br/>
  You can compare this graphed result to 2023 data by running plot_2023.py, which uses data/raw-2023/market.csv data <br/> <br/>

  Optionally, if you want to view the linear regression model's accuracy for each stock, you can run linear_regression_individual_stock.py, which uses the data/raw-2022 directory rather than a file. This is to ensure the code iterates for each stock in the directory.

  **ARIMA Model** <br/><br/>

  arima.py <br/>
